      <h4 className="font-medium mt-2 text-stone-600">
        I. The Factories Act, 1948
      </h4>
      <p className="font-extralight">
        Imagine a factory where people make things. This law is like a safety
        manual for factories. It says that factories must be safe places to
        work. Here's what it tells us:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className="font-semibold">Register Your Factory:</span> If you
          have a big factory, you need to tell the government about it. This
          way, they can check if it's safe.
        </li>
        <li className="mt-1">
          <span className="font-semibold">Don't Work Too Long:</span> You
          shouldn't work for too many hours in a row. You need breaks to rest
          and stay healthy.
        </li>
        <li className="mt-1">
          <span className="font-semibold">Keep the Factory Clean:</span>{" "}
          Factories should be clean, with good air to breathe, and clean
          bathrooms.
        </li>
        <li className="mt-1">
          <span className="font-semibold">No Kids Allowed:</span> Children under
          14 can't work in factories because it's not safe for them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr className="mt-2" />
      <h4 className="font-medium mt-2 text-stone-600">
        II. The Mines Act, 1952
      </h4>
      <p className="font-extralight">
        Now, think about people who work in mines, digging for things like
        minerals and coal. Mining can be dangerous, so this law wants to make
        sure miners are safe. Here's what it says:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span className="font-semibold">Check Mines:</span> Mines should be
          checked often to make sure they are safe to work in.
        </li>

          miners have fresh air, clean water, and access to medical help.

          measures in place to stop accidents and keep miners safe.

        III. The Building and Other Construction Workers Act, 1996
      </h4>
      <p className="font-extralight">
        Construction work can be risky, so this law helps people who work in
        construction. It does a few things to keep them safe:

        <li>
          <span className="font-semibold">Register Workers:</span> Construction
          workers should sign up to get help when they need it. This helps them
